Due to popular demand... well, I had a couple of requests anyway :-) Heres
a post inspired by my recent encounters profiling some of the code in
[Fracture-IO](https://github.com/fractureio/fracture).  <!-- more -->I have recently been
profiling the code in fracture to remove any so called low hanging fruits.
During this time I also noticed an increase in memory allocation.  I
remembered I had recently been experimenting in a branch using pipelets as a
buffer between the send and receive stages in the Http Server, so I set up a
simple test to see if pipelets were contributing to the memory allocation
issues I was seeing.  Here's the simple iteration test code I used for the
memory profiling:

{% gist 1557610 test_code.fs %}

Using process explorer from Mark Russinovich I watched the allocated memory
grow as the iterations progressed:

Theres definitely something leaking in there! So what can we do to find this?
Simple, we use a memory profiler.  There are several really good memory
profilers out there.  I have listed some of the best ones below:

  * [SciTech memory profiler](http://memprofiler.com/)
  * [RedGates ANTS Memory Profiler](http://www.red-gate.com/products/dotnet-development/ants-memory-profiler/)
  * [JetBrains dotTrace](http://www.jetbrains.com/profiler/)
  * [YourKit Profiler for .NET](http://www.yourkit.com/dotnet/features/index.jsp)
To demonstrate finding the leak I will be using [RedGates ANTS MemoryProfiler](http://www.red-gate.com/products/dotnet-development/ants-memory-
profiler/).

First of all we launch the profiler and set it up to profile the application,
this is just a simple case of browsing to the release folder and picking the
application so I won't bore with those trivial details here. Now that the
application is running we hit any key which caused the test application to
post 100 operations into the pipeline.  We want to create a baseline snapshot
of the memory allocation so we can see where our leak is.  To do this click
Take Memory Snapshot at the top right of the screen.  Next we hit any key
again in the test application, again causing it to post another 100 operations
into the pipeline.  Now we click Take Memory Snapshot again. Now we have a
snapshot of the difference between the two operations.  The summery screen is
shown below:

{% img https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-N72POVbq0ZA/TuS7v0xBt1I/AAAAAAAABNQ/ExKfkJDCb50/s912/3%2Bsummary.png %}

From this screen you can see that there is 51.56KB of new memory allocated
since the last snapshot, and you can see some nice piecharts showing the
various allocations in G1, G2 etc.  On the right hand side of the pie chart
you can see that the largest classes are: object[], AsyncParamsAux,
Pipelets+loop@37-7<Unit, string,string>, and AsyncParams<Unit>.

Now if we click on Class List button we can investigate these further, heres
the Class List:

{% img https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-UDU20rPk7ck/TuS7xvK_67I/AAAAAAAABNg/tnxTlpBYBJg/s912/4%2Bclass%2Blist.png %}

Here things start to get interesting.  If you click on the instance Diff (+/-)
column you can sort the list of classed by the differences to the last
snapshot.

Now looking at the results we have:

  * 300 more instances of AsyncBuilderImpl, AsyncParamsArgs, and AsyncParams
  * 200 more instances of Pipelets+loop@37-7<Unit, string, string>
  * 100 more instances of Pipelets+loop@37-7<Unit, string, FSharpRef<int>>

Is it a coincidence that we just pushed 100 operations through the pipeline?
I think not!

Now that we have a target for further inspection we can highlight the row for
the function **Pipelets+loop@37-7<Unit, string, FSharpRef<int>>>** and then
click on the icon that has three little blue boxes on it.  This will take us
to the instance List as shown below:

{% img https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-csF589rWobQ/TuS7wzT6NWI/AAAAAAAABNY/TM95SUmaCEQ/s912/5%2Binstance%2Blist.png %}

I have sorted the instance list by the distance from the GC Root, you can see
there is a strange pattern emerging, the GC root distant increase by three
each time.  Now lets look at the Instance Retention graph for the first one
with a GC Root distance of 9, this is the icon on the right hand side of the
function name, it looks like a few rectangles joined up with a line:

{% img https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-9orgQ4etsdI/TuS7yE-Dh7I/AAAAAAAABNs/0-dc3x8u-Mo/s525/first.png %}

The Pipelets+loop function is linked from the mailbox processor shown at the
top of the graph and flows into the Async infrastructure, and finally to the
loop function at the bottom.

Lets look at the next one, this has a GC Root distance of 12:

{% img https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-j1eALRVz0kA/TuS7z0ycXDI/AAAAAAAABN8/SGPVpPQbSz0/s531/second.png %}

If you look carefully there is another pattern here, the field references
args, aux@, econt@ are repeated in the red boxes.  The functions look to be
quite similar too.  Lets look at the next one GC Root Distance  of 15:

{% img https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-d3V1WkCktTM/TuS7zxVnizI/AAAAAAAABOA/wA5xlP-UTxA/s646/third.png %}

Looking at this we have a definite repeat of the functions and arguments,  if
we look down to GC Root at a depth of 60 we get this:

{% img https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-X3v-_UfEkI4/TuS7xzETTHI/AAAAAAAABNk/js7xg3GTHIo/s640/60.png %}

So whats happening here is that there is a continuation that has been built
around the asynchronous calls that gets bigger and bigger on each iteration.

Now that we have identified the leak, lets look at the code and see whats
going on.  That would be the loop function in Pipelets:

{% gist 1557610 leaky_mailbox.fs %}

Have a look at lines 9 and 12.  Can you guess whats wrong?

Well, to quote the [F# Teams blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/fsharpteam/archive/2011/07/08/tail-calls-in-fsharp.aspx):

> On the .NET platform, there are limitations on where tail calls may occur.
One restriction is that tail calls cannot be performed in try-catch or try-
finally blocks (neither in the body of the try nor in the catch or finally
handlers).

It goes on further to discuss another subtle issue with use bindings:

> use bindings implicitly generate a try-finally around the code that follows
them to ensure that the Dispose method is called on the bound value.  This
means that no calls following a use binding will be tail calls.

So all we have to do change the way the try catch block is formulated in that
section.  The most idiomatic way of dealing with this is to use the
[Async.Catch function](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee353899.aspx)
which would result in code something like the following:

{% gist 1557610 async_catch.fs %}

Alternatively you could move the entire try with section out to a more local
section thats not in the recursive async loop construct:

{% gist 1557610 move_try.fs %}

Anyway I hope that sheds a bit of light on how to spot where memory leaks are
stemming from, and also some of the little known and often forgotten caveats
with tail recursion.

Until next time...

**EDIT**: Just to make things a little bit clearer.  The memory leak here is caused by the async block being transformed into chains of continuation passing-style functions, and due to tail call elimination not being possible inside of the try catch blocks, the continuation grows and grows during each recursion.
