### Welcome to part two

[Part 1](http://moiraesoftware.com/?p=39) Part 2 [Part
3](http://moiraesoftware.com/?p=139) [Part
4](http://moiraesoftware.com/?p=180)

Lets jump in at the deep end and take a look at some code...

When you look at the method syntax for the xxxAsync methods you will notice
they return a boolean value that indicates if the method completed
synchronously, this means that you have to check the return value every time
you use one of the methods and invoke the callback yourself if it completes
synchronously.  In practice this hardly ever happens, and normally only on a
send operation.  But as it is a possibility we will add module with a some
extension methods in to help us out, this will make the code more readable and
avoid unnecessary duplication.

### SocketExtensions

    
    module SocketExtensions
      open System
      open System.Net
      open System.Net.Sockets  
      type Socket with
        /// extension method to make async based call easier, this ensures the callback always gets
        /// called even if there is an error or the async method completed syncronously
        member s.InvokeAsyncMethod( asyncmethod, callback, args:SocketAsyncEventArgs) =
          let result = asyncmethod args
          if result <> true then callback args
        member s.AcceptAsyncSafe(callback, args) = s.InvokeAsyncMethod(s.AcceptAsync, callback, args)
        member s.ReceiveAsyncSafe(callback, args) = s.InvokeAsyncMethod(s.ReceiveAsync, callback, args)
        member s.SendAsyncSafe(callback, args) = s.InvokeAsyncMethod(s.SendAsync, callback, args)
        member s.DisconnectAsyncSafe(callback, args) = s.InvokeAsyncMethod(s.DisconnectAsync, callback, args)

Now lets get down to business, the next few types have a fair bit of code in
them so I will briefly explain each type in turn:

### BocketPool

A BocketPool is a combination of a
[SocketAsyncEventArgs](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-
us/library/system.net.sockets.socketasynceventargs.aspx) object and a chunk of
memory allocated in an array.  The array is sliced up into sections and
allocated for each send or receive operation by setting a start and end index
using [SetBuffer()](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb549836.aspx).
If you remember last time I mentioned that a lot of memory fragmentation can
occur during sending and receiving due to continuously allocating memory
buffers on the Socket object, this is primarily done through the BeginSend and
BeginReceive methods passing in a byte array.  Using the BocketPool it a great
way of reducing the amount of garbage collection during heavy traffic.

The other major difference with SocketAsyncEventArgs is the way in which you
make the send and receive calls, heres the general flow that occurs:

* Create a SocketAsyncEventArgs object or get one from a pool.
* Allocate an array to the buffer.
* Allocate an offset and length to the buffer.
* Allocate a callback method.
* Call Socket.xxxAsync passing in the SocketAsyncEventArgs, the operation will complete and invoke the callback.
What we are going to do is wrap the whole creation, array allocation, and
offsetting to the BocketPool:

    
    namespace Fes
      open System
      open System.Net.Sockets
      open System.Collections.Concurrent  
      type BocketPool( number, size, callback) as this =
        let number = number
        let size = size
        let totalsize = (number * size)
        let buffer = Array.create totalsize 0uy
        let pool = new BlockingCollection<SocketAsyncEventArgs>(number:int)
        let mutable disposed = false
        let cleanUp() =
          if not disposed then
            disposed <- true
            pool.CompleteAdding()
            while pool.Count > 1 do
              (pool.Take() :> IDisposable).Dispose()
            pool.Dispose()
        do
          let rec loop n =
            match n with
            | x when x < totalsize ->
              let saea = new SocketAsyncEventArgs()
              saea.Completed |> Observable.add( fun saea -> (callback saea))
              saea.SetBuffer(buffer, n, size)
              this.CheckIn(saea)
              loop (n + size)
            | _ -> ()
          loop 0
        member this.CheckOut()=
          pool.Take()
        member this.CheckIn(saea)=
          pool.Add(saea)
        member this.Count =
          pool.Count
        interface IDisposable with
          member this.Dispose() = cleanUp()

Next up we have to look at the Connection and the Tcplistener types as two
interconnected entities:

* The TcpListener listens for a connection on a socket and port number.
* The client connects to the server.
* An accept socket is allocated to the client, at this point we have one socket for the server and once for each client.
* We also need to allocate a BocketPool for send and receive operation for each client
To simplify things we are going to encapsulate the accept socket management
into a type, it will also need a corresponding BocketPool to service any send
and receive operations to and from the client

### Connection

    
    namespace Fes
      open System
      open System.Net
      open System.Net.Sockets
      open System.Collections.Generic
      open System.Collections.Concurrent
      open System.Threading
      open SocketExtensions  
      type Connection(maxreceives, maxsends, size, socket:Socket) as this =
        let socket = socket
        let maxreceives = maxreceives
        let maxsends = maxsends
        let sendPool = new BocketPool(maxsends, size, this.sendCompleted )
        let receivePool = new BocketPool(maxreceives, size, this.receiveCompleted)
        let mutable disposed = false
        let mutable anyErrors = false  
        let cleanUp() =
          if not disposed then
            disposed <- true
            socket.Shutdown(SocketShutdown.Both)
            socket.Disconnect(false)
            socket.Close()
            (sendPool :> IDisposable).Dispose()
            (receivePool :> IDisposable).Dispose()  
        member this.Start() =
          socket.ReceiveAsyncSafe(this.receiveCompleted, receivePool.CheckOut())  
        member this.Stop() =
          socket.Close(2)  
        member this.receiveCompleted (args: SocketAsyncEventArgs) =
          try
            match args.LastOperation with
            | SocketAsyncOperation.Receive ->
              match args.SocketError with
              | SocketError.Success ->
                socket.ReceiveAsyncSafe( this.receiveCompleted, receivePool.CheckOut())
                let data = Array.create args.BytesTransferred 0uy
                Buffer.BlockCopy(args.Buffer, args.Offset, data, 0, data.Length)
                let client = args.RemoteEndPoint
                args.RemoteEndPoint <- null
                data |> printfn "received data: %A"
              | _ -> args.SocketError.ToString() |> printfn "socket error on receive: %s"
            | _ -> failwith "unknown operation, should be receive"
          finally
            receivePool.CheckIn(args)  
        member this.sendCompleted (args: SocketAsyncEventArgs) =
          try
            match args.LastOperation with
            | SocketAsyncOperation.Send ->
              match args.SocketError with
              | SocketError.Success ->
                ()
              | SocketError.NoBufferSpaceAvailable
              | SocketError.IOPending
              | SocketError.WouldBlock ->
                if not(anyErrors) then
                  anyErrors <- true
                  failwith "Buffer overflow or send buffer timeout"
              | _ -> args.SocketError.ToString() |> printfn "socket error on send: %s"
            | _ -> failwith "invalid operation, should be receive"
          finally
            sendPool.CheckIn(args)  
        member this.Send (msg:byte[]) =
          let s = sendPool.CheckOut()
          Buffer.BlockCopy(msg, 0, s.Buffer, s.Offset, msg.Length)
          socket.SendAsyncSafe(this.sendCompleted, s)

Finally here's the TcpListener type.  It is responsible for creating an
initial Connection object for each client and starts asynchronous sending
messages to that client once a second, also notice that there is another
BlockingCollection involved, this is somewhat simpler than the usage in the
bocketPool as we have no buffer to manage here.

* _It is possible to fill the initial Buffer property, this causes the buffer to be sent to the client as soon as it has connected to the server, this can be useful to sent initial data to the client, such as protocol definitions etc)_
A finite number of connections can occur before blocking will occur depending
on the number of AsyncEventArgs in the collection, this stops potential denial
of service attacks due to too many connection being made.

### TcpListener

Its a fair bit of code to take in at once, so Ill leave you with it to ponder
over.  Ill be explaining all of the interesting bits in more detail in part
three...

Please feel free to leave any comments you have, especially on better use of
functional constructs.
